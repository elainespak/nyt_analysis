# Online Contents Popularity Analysis with New York Times data

* Why analyze online contents popularity?
In the digital era, everyone is competing for attention. Our goal is to analyze the relationship between online contents (description of the article on Twitter, NYT article content) and their popularity (number of Retweets and Likes on Twitter).

* Methodology
We primarily use the GetOldTweets3 package to scrape data from the @nytimes Twitter acount, and regular expression and BeautifulSoup4 to extract features from each article.

* Data scope
Every NYT article that was published from 2016/01/01 to 2018/12/31
